# Voice & Tone

This is a short manual on how to write in a similar tone to mine.

## Voice

There are a few key points to pay attention to when writing flavor text in my tone:

1. You should write text in a lively voice as if you were having a conversation with someone.
2. Utilizing terminology is reasonable to a certain extent as it adds to the voice personality.
	- You can always <abbr title="Using a shortened form of a word or phrase.">abbreviate</abbr> terminology.

3. Keep paragraphs short and sweet - feel free to divide text into smaller sections to improve readability.

## Tone

I try to keep a consistent tone across all my communications: mails, social media posts, etc.

- Friendly
- Straightforward
- Informal

Sometimes it's good to lighten up the mood a bit: for this i use
- Memes
- Puns/wordplays
- References (pop-culture/whatever the target audience is)

## Style

Keep these things in mind when writing to stay in line with the tone of voice.

- Stay consistent across all written media 
- Keep a friendly and informal voice
- Feel free to use terminology to some extent, but do not overuse it.
- Divide longer sections of texts into shorter, more easy to read paragraphs.

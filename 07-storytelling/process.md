# The process of: Making less boring renders (The importance of light & shadows)

My thought process was really simple. A while back i watched a video by one of my favourite YouTube creators, *Theo Kerr*. Coincidentally, the video also showed the importance of light and shadows so i shamelessly decided to copy his idea for my presentation, as i was truly amazed by the difference proper light usage could make when creating a 3D render.

I really recommend to check out the video in its full length, as it's very detailed and a much better tutorial than I could ever dream of making. Despite this, I found that some of the key points made in the video could be used for a short and sweet demo of how light can play with everyday objects.

The slides were merely a supportive element to the demo, to get the audience a bit interested. I deliberately chose not to do a video or a picture slideshow for the entirety of the presentation to show some type of workflow that I am comfortable with. Not only is it more suitable to follow along then, but you can also troubleshoot some common errors and mistakes live, as well as making your presentation very engaging.

As a small bonus, it helped me to reduce some anxiety I had to show a live workflow - a lot can go wrong here (or so I thought) but ultimately things went pretty smooth. The most important thing is to be prepared, so I spent a couple of hours the day before recreating the file again from scratch to really make sure I got all the details in and to make sure I could dig myself out of a hole if things went *REALLY* south.

I didn't prepare any notes. Although counterproductive, I feel it gave my presentation a distinct human element - not being bound by any set themes or topics gave me the freedom to go along with the slides and only say things I deemed necessary at that point.

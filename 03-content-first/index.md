## My Story

![Front portrait of a young male in a black baseball cap with dramatic red lighting coming from the right.](images/profile.jpeg)

A series of short paragraphs (one to three) about who you are, beyond being a designer; a personal bio that tells your story, with an emphasis on keywords about what you do, your passions, experience, etc. Consider each paragraph as two to three short, meaningful descriptions (120 characters each). Don’t worry about length — write first — then edit for clarity and conciseness later.

## Featured Project

- Not many people show you how to create art similar to theirs, so i set out to replicate a artist i enjoy following.

# Visual identity for a non-profit organization

by Max Měšťan

## Abstract

The goal of this bachelor’s thesis is to examine the problematic of domestic violence against women in the Czech republic. According to studies conducted by the European Fundamental Rights Agency, about one in three women have had some kind of experience with abuse (verbal, physical or mental) and only around 5% of victims reach out and get help. I will be developing a visual identity package for the ROSA centre for victims of domestic abuse, which is a non-profit organization with a very prominent history in the field.

To communicate appropriately and accurately, interviews will be conducted with the workers of the ROSA centre. This is especially important as i need to develop a design language that is straightforward enough to push victims torwards getting the help they need instead of complicating the path further.

I would like to propose a solution to the current identity of the ROSA centre, which is by now more than 6 years old and is starting to show its age. There is no overarching design language and the old visual identity isn’t flexible enough for the entire scope of work ROSA does.
